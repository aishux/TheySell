After each march, rally, or inspirational moment of gathering, many of us will have a moment of wondering “What now?” After the Women’s or LQBTQ's March last weekend, the work to support gender equality does not stop and it must continue to evolve. TheySell is an initiative to empower women and LGBTQ in Indian society by connecting them to customers worldwide through anonymous and safe selling.The trans and queer youth who are houseless, in foster care, or otherwise without vital support receive the money they want and the affirmation they need from people all over the world. Help us show young trans people that they are loved and cherished exactly for who they are!
